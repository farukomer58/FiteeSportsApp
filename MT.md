|               | CODE |TEST | DEVOPS   |OVERALL   |
|---------------|------|-----|----------|--------------------|
| Name Student1  |  1  | 1 |   3    | 2 |

#### What went well:
 - Master of operations!

#### (Even) better if:
- camelCase code convention would be used.
- you would test your logic and not test getters and setters.
- read the rubric!
